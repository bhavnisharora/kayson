        <h2>Message from Chairman</h2>
        <p>
          I am delighted to share a pivotal development at Kayson Thinners &
          Chemicals, a prominent player in the manufacturing of Paints, Thinners
          and Tin Containers. Over the years, our commitment to delivering
          top-notch quality products has solidified our position as a trusted
          brand, particularly in North India.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, I am thrilled to unveil a significant milestone – Kayson
          Thinners & Chemicals is extending its legacy into the world of
          decorative paints. Our proficiency in crafting high-quality industrial
          solutions now converges with a foray into the consumer realm. Our
          dedicated team has channelled its expertise to create a range of
          decorative paints that seamlessly blend our industrial expertise with
          aesthetic delicacy. These paints are not just about adding colour,
          they symbolize the durability, innovation, and superior quality
          synonymous with the Kayson brand.
          <br />
          <br />
          While we have been a stronghold in North India, I am pleased to
          announce our expansion into Delhi NCR and other states. This expansion
          is a testament to our vision of introducing excellence in paint and
          chemical thinners to a broader audience. As we diversify our
          offerings, we assure you that the same commitment to quality and
          reliability will be the hallmark of our decorative paints. For those
          joining us on this journey, we extend a warm welcome and promise an
          enriching experience with Kayson.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for your unwavering support. We look forward to defining new
          standards in the decorative paints industry, fuelled by our passion
          for quality and excellence.

          <br />
